    "To really have a Smart Search Engine or Virtual assistant that can answer any question about your corporate documents, this \"engine\" must understand tabular data, aka, sources with tables, rows and columns with numbers. \n",
    "This is a different problem that simply looking for the top most similar results.  The concept of indexing, bringing top results, embedding, doing a cosine semantic search and summarize an answer, doesn't really apply to this problem.\n",
    "We are dealing now with sources with Tables in which each row and column are related to each other, and in order to answer a question, all of the data is needed, not just top results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the goal is to show how to deal with this kind of use cases. To continue with our Covid-19 theme, we will be using an open dataset called [\"Covid Tracking Project\"](https://covidtracking.com/data/download). The COVID Tracking Project dataset is a  CSV file that provides the latest numbers on tests, confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes from every US state and territory (they stopped tracking on March 7 2021).\n",

    "Imagine that many documents on a data lake are tabular data, or that your use case is to ask questions in natural language to a LLM model and this model needs to get the context from a CSV file or even a SQL Database in order to answer the question. A GPT Smart Search Engine, must understand how to deal with this sources, understand the data and answer acoordingly."

    "Agents are a way to leverage the ability of LLMs to understand and act on prompts. In essence, an Agent is an LLM that has been given a very clever initial prompt. The prompt tells the LLM to break down the process of answering a complex query into a sequence of steps that are resolved one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents become really cool when we combine them with ‘experts’, introduced in the MRKL paper. Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself. This is actually the concept behind [ChatGPT Pluggins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n",

    "In our case, in order to solve the problem \"How do I ask questions to a tabular CSV file\", we need this REACT/MRKL approach, in which we need to instruct the LLM that it needs to use an 'expert/tool' in order to read/load/understand/interact with a CSV tabular file.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI opened the world to a whole new concept. Libraries are being created fast and furious. We will be using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) as our library to solve this problem, however there are others that we recommend: [HayStack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) and [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/whatissk)."

      "Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "We first set the pandas display options to show all columns and got the column names using `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)` and `print(df.columns)`. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, we used pandasql to query the dataframe and get the number of hospitalized patients in Texas and nationwide during July 2020.

      "\n",
      "To get the number of hospitalized patients in Texas, we used `tx_df = sqldf(\"SELECT * FROM july_df WHERE state = 'TX'\")` to filter the dataframe to only include data from Texas, and then used `tx_hosp = tx_df['hospitalized'].sum()` to get the sum of the hospitalized column for Texas. \n",
      "\n",
      "To get the nationwide total of hospitalized patients, we used `nationwide_hosp = sqldf(\"SELECT SUM(hospitalized) FROM july_df GROUP BY state\").sum()` to get the sum of the hospitalized column for all states. \n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: \n",
      "\n",
      "The number of hospitalized patients in Texas during July 2020 was 107,317, and the nationwide total of hospitalized patients during July 2020 was 5,322,982.\u001b[0m\n",
