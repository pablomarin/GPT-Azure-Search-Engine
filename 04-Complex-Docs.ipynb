    "In the previous notebook, we developed a solution for various types of files and data formats commonly found in organizations, and this covers big majority of the use cases. However, you will find that there are issues when dealing with questions that require answers from complex files. The complexity of these files arises from their length and the way information is distributed within them. Large documents are always a challenge for Search Engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of such complex files is Technical Specification Guides or Product Manuals, which can span hundreds of pages and contain information in the form of images, tables, forms, and more. Books are also complex due to their length and the presence of images or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are typically in PDF format. To better handle these PDFs, we need a smarter parsing method that treats each document as a special source and processes them page by page (1 page = 1 chunk). The objective is to obtain more accurate and faster answers from our system. Fortunately, there are usually not many of these types of documents in an organization, allowing us to make exceptions and treat them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your use case is just PDFs, for example, you can just use [PyPDF library](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) or [Azure AI Document Intelligence SDK (former Form Recognizer)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview?view=doc-intel-3.0.0), vectorize using OpenAI API and push the content to a vector-based index. And this is problably the simplest and fastest way to go.  However if your use case entails connecting to a datalake, or Sharepoint libraries or any other document data source with thousands of documents with multiple file types and that can change dynamically, then you would want to use the Ingestion and Document Cracking and AI-Enrichment capabilities of Azure Search engine, Notebooks 1-3, and avoid a lot of painful custom code. \n"

He emphasizes that working for money is not the goal, but rather having money work for oneself. The rich dad also imparts the importance of being financially savvy and aware of the opportunities to create assets and generate income. This is demonstrated when the rich dad advises Robert to seek a good job in a solid company or to learn how to buy a good company.\n",

      "Rich Dad and Poor Dad have different approaches and mindsets regarding money and financial education, as described in Robert Kiyosaki's book \"Père riche, Père pauvre\" (Rich Dad Poor Dad). Here are some of the key differences between what Rich Dad does compared to Poor Dad:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Financial Education**: Rich Dad believes in the importance of understanding how money works and learning to make money work for you. He encourages studying how to become wealthy and understanding the functioning of money, whereas Poor Dad emphasizes traditional education and finding a well-paying job[[3]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Working for Money vs. Money Working for You**: Rich Dad teaches that the rich don't work for money; instead, they make money work for them. Poor Dad, on the other hand, advises working hard to earn money from a job[[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Investing**: Rich Dad focuses on investing in assets that generate income, while Poor Dad tends to view a house as the most significant investment, which Rich Dad considers a liability if it doesn't generate income[[28]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf)[[94]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Taxes**: Rich Dad teaches ways to minimize tax liabilities legally, while Poor Dad might not have the same level of understanding or strategy to deal with taxes[[53]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Mindset**: Rich Dad has a proactive mindset, asking questions like \"How can I afford this?\" instead of saying \"I can't afford this.\" This mindset encourages thinking and problem-solving, as opposed to accepting limitations[[28]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Paying Yourself First**: Rich Dad practices the habit of paying himself first before anyone else, even if funds are limited, to prioritize building assets over paying bills. Poor Dad tends to pay everyone else first and himself last, often resulting in nothing left to pay himself[[196]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Ownership and Control**: Rich Dad encourages owning businesses and investments, while Poor Dad promotes the idea of working for a company and climbing the corporate ladder[[126]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Risk Management**: Rich Dad teaches how to manage and take calculated risks with money, whereas Poor Dad advises against taking risks with money[[28]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "These differences highlight the contrasting philosophies between Rich Dad and Poor Dad regarding money, investing, and financial education, which Kiyosaki presents through the narrative of having two father figures with opposing financial perspectives."
