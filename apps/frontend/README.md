Frontend Web Application - Search + Web Bot Channel
</h1>

Simple UI using Streamlit to expose the Bot Service Channel.
Also includes a Search experience.
 
## Deploy in Azure Web App Service

1. Deploy the Frontend Azure Web Application by clicking the Button below

[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpablomarin%2FGPT-Azure-Search-Engine%2Fmain%2Fapps%2Ffrontend%2Fazuredeploy-frontend.json)

2. Zip the code of the bot by executing the following command in the terminal (you have to be inside the folder: apps/frontend/ ):
```bash
zip frontend.zip ./*
zip frontend.zip ./pages/*
zip -j frontend.zip ../../common/*
```
3. Using the Azure CLI deploy the bot code to the Azure App Service created on Step 2
```bash
az login -i
az webapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group "<resource-group-name>" --name "<name-of-frontend-app-service>" --src "frontend.zip"
```

**Note**: Some FDPO Azure Subscriptions disable Azure Web Apps Basic Authentication every minute (don't know why). So before running the above az webapp deployment command, make sure that your frontend azure web app has Basic Authentication ON. In the Azure Portal, you can find this settting in: Configuration->General Settings. Don't worry if after running the command it says retrying many times, the zip files already uploaded and is building.

4. In a few minutes (5-10) your App should be working now. Go to the Azure Portal and get the URL.

## Troubleshoot

1. If WebApp deployed succesfully but the Application didn't start
   1. Go to Azure portal -> Your Webapp -> Settings -> Configuration -> General Settings
   2. Make sure that StartUp Command has:  python -m streamlit run Home.py --server.port 8000 --server.address 0.0.0.0

2. If running locally fails with error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'type' and '_GenericAlias'"
Check your list of conda environments and activate one with Python 3.10 or higher
For example, if you are running the app on an Azure ML compute instance:
    ```
    conda env list
    conda activate azureml_py310_sdkv2
    ```
