    "- It uses a \"branch per environment approach\". The deploy environment name is computed at 'runtime' based on a branch/env-name mapping logic in the \"set environment for branch\" step (line 29). The current implemented logic maps everything to a dev like environment. Therefore on each git push on the `main branch` the pipeline is triggered trying to deploy to an environment called `Development`. For more info about GitHub environments and how to set specific env variables and secrets read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment).\n",

Go to your forked repository in GitHub and create an [environment]((https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)) called 'Development' (yes this exact name; don't change it). If you want to change the environment name, add new branches and environments  or change the current branch/env mapping you can do that, but make sure to change the pipeline code accordingly in `.github/workflows/main_gptsmartsearch_apps.yml` (starting line 29)\n",

You'll need to copy paste the xml content from the .PublishSettings file into the secret value:\n",
    "     - Create a secret with name `AZUREAPPSERVICE_BACKEND_PUBLISHPROFILE` and set the Value field to publish profile of the azure web app you created using 'Deploy to Azure' button in `apps/backend/README.md`\n",
    "     - Create a secret with name `AZUREAPPSERVICE_FRONTEND_PUBLISHPROFILE` and set the Value field to publish profile of the azure web app you created using 'Deploy to Azure' button in `apps/frontend/README.md`\n",
    "3. Create 'Development' environment [variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-environment) for both frontend and backend azure web app resource names:\n",
    "    - Create a variable with name `AZURE_WEBAPP_BACKEND_NAME` and set the Value field to the azure web app resource name you created using 'Deploy to Azure' button in `apps/backend/README.md`\n",
