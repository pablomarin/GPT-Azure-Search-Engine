    "As previously discussed in our other notebooks, **harnessing agents and tools is an effective approach**. We aim to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's large language models (LLM), such as GPT-4 and its successors, to perform the heavy lifting of reasoning and researching on our behalf.\n",

For instance, we may wish to **enrich an answer with information available on the web**, or **provide users with up-to-date and recent information**, or **finding information on an specific public website**. Regardless of the scenario, we require our engine to base its responses on search results.\n",
