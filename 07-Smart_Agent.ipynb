    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer bu using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We used a Utility Chain in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

Other possible risk factors include socioeconomic status, diet, lifestyle, geographical differences, ethnicity, exposed viral load, day of initiation of treatment, and quality of health care. Laboratory parameters to monitor disease progression include lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), and ferritin.
