    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",

       "Markov chains are mathematical systems that undergo transitions from one state to another in a stochastic manner, based on certain probabilistic rules. They are characterized by the Markovian property, which states that the future state of the system depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of previous states.
