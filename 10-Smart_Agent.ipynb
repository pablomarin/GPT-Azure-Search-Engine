    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

Parents should enforce consequences when boundaries are crossed, which helps children understand the relationship between actions and consequences<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
