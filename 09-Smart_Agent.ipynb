    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

This helps them understand that their actions can affect others and that they need to consider others' feelings and needs<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

       " AIMessage(content='Setting boundaries with children is a crucial aspect of their development. Here are some strategies and reasons for setting boundaries:\\n\\n1. Teach children to respect others\\' boundaries: Children need to learn not only to set their own boundaries but also to respect those set by others.

Encourage expression of feelings: Allowing children to express their feelings, including anger, grief, loss, or sadness, helps them understand their own needs and emotions. This encourages them to set boundaries based on their feelings<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. Maintain consistent and age-appropriate boundaries: It\\'s essential to set and keep age-appropriate boundaries with children.

Help children internalize structure: By setting boundaries, you can help children internalize things that were external to them. This helps children develop character and prevent many problems that adults struggle with<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\\n\\nRemember, setting boundaries with children is not about controlling them, but rather about teaching them to respect themselves and others. It\\'s about helping them understand their feelings and needs, and how their actions affect others.
