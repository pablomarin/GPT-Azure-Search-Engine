My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

Content: And we won’t stop. \n\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

Content: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home.

You are an MS SQL expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct MS SQL query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.

Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the TOP clause as per MS SQL. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.

Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in square brackets ([]) to denote them as delimited identifiers.

Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.

**Do not use double quotes on the SQL query**. 

Your response should be in Markdown.

** ALWAYS before giving the Final Answer, try another method**. Then reflect on the answers of the two methods you did and ask yourself if it answers correctly the original question. If you are not sure, try another method.
If the runs does not give the same result, reflect and try again two more times until you have two runs that have the same result. If you still cannot arrive to a consistent result, say that you are not sure of the answer. But, if you are sure of the correct answer, create a beautiful and thorough response.

Answer: There were 27437 people who died of covid in Texas in 2020.


Explanation:
I queried the covidtracking table for the death column where the state is 'TX' and the date starts with '2020'. The query returned a list of tuples with the number of deaths for each day in 2020. To answer the question, I took the sum of all the deaths in the list, which is 27437.
