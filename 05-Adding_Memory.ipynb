RL can be used in interactive recommender systems to dynamically maintain a balance between accuracy and fairness in recommendations[5].\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the use cases of reinforcement learning. RL can also be applied in domains such as robotics, finance, and gaming, among others. Let me know if there\\'s anything else I can help with!\\n\\nReferences:\\n[1]<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup> [2]<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206183/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup> [3]<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14093v2.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup> [4]<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/0212/0212025v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup> [5]<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206277/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a></sup>')]"

    "We also can notice that the current chain that we are using is smart, but not that much. Although we have given memory to it, it searches for similar docs everytime, regardless of the input and it struggles to respond to prompts like: Hello, Thank you, Bye, What's your name, What's the weather and any other task that is not search in the knowledge base.\n",

    "**GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k** resembles the same 7-year-old, but with an increased attention span for longer instructions. However, it still faces difficulties accurately executing them about half the time.\n",

    "**GPT-4** exhibits the capabilities of a 10-12-year-old child. It possesses enhanced reasoning skills and more consistently adheres to instructions. While its memory retention for instructions is moderate, it excels at following them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4-32k** is akin to the 10-12-year-old child with an extended memory. It comprehends lengthy sets of instructions and engages in meaningful conversations. Thanks to its robust memory, it offers detailed responses.\n",
