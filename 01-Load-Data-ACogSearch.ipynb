We will be walking you to a series of notebooks in which you will understand how RAG works (Retrieval Augmented Generation, a technique that combines the power of search and generation of AI to answer user queries).

    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we create and run enrichment steps to unlock searchable content in the specified Azure blob. It performs operations over mixed content in Azure Storage, such as images and application files, using a skillset that analyzes and extracts text information that becomes searchable in Azure Cognitive Search. \n",
    "The reference sample can be found at [Tutorial: Use Python and AI to generate searchable content from Azure blobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python).\n",

    "In this demo we are going to be using a private (so we can mimic a private data lake scenario) Blob Storage container that has ~9.8k Computer Science publication PDFs from the Arxiv dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to explore the dataset, go [HERE](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/arxiv-dataset/arxiv/cs/pdf?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false)<br>\n",
    "Note: This dataset has been copy to a public azure blob container for this demo\n",

    "Although only  PDF files are used here, this can be done at a much larger scale and Azure Cognitive Search supports a range of other file formats including: Microsoft Office (DOCX/DOC, XSLX/XLS, PPTX/PPT, MSG), HTML, XML, ZIP, and plain text files (including JSON).\n",

See this [Python quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-python) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you should have already created the Azure services on README. Once you've done this, you can run all cells, but the query won't return results until the indexer is finished and the search index is loaded. \n",
